aws-sdk-for-php2
================

A copy of the code and dependencies of the [ADS SDK for PHP 2](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/guide/latest/index.html), for use by the Drupal module [S3 File System](https://drupal.org/sandbox/coredumperror/2097947). Because S3 File System cannot enforce the use of Composer or PEAR upon its users, and the zip and phar versions of the SDK are only available for the newest release, this repo is needed in order to provide a stable, known-to-work version of the entire AWS SDK ecosystem.

Current SDK version: 2.4.10 (2013-11-14)
